# PYBER ANALYSIS

## Overview of the Project

The overview of this project is to analyze the PyBer ride-sharing data for 2019 using Pandas & 
matplotlib to create a summary DataFrame of the data grouped by Rural, Urban and Suburban cities. 
The analysis and visualization created from this project will help PyBer improve access to
ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 


## Results

From the data above, we can see that the Urban cities were the most profitable doing ride-sharing.  
They had 1625 total rides, 2405 total drivers, $39,854.38 in fares and their average price her ride was 
$24.53. Rural cities had the least number of rides at 125, the least drivers and the lowest total fares at $4,327.93; however,
rural cities had the highest average price per fare. In Urban cities, the supply is higher than the demand for ride-sharing,
so the prices have to be lower in order to encourage people to use this service. However, in the rural cities, demand is higher 
than the supply, so there is less drivers for the number of rides demanded. Therefore, more money will be charged in the rural cities.


## Summary

- There is a possibility that the rural cities are poorer and cannot afford ride-sharing services. The company should consider 
  lowering their prices or offering monthly promotions as an incentives to riders. The company can also consider more ways
  to employ more drivers at a competitive pay rate. This will not only help the company gain more profit due to the supply 
  increasing, but it will also help the economic stature of the rural cities.
  
- Suburban cities have been doing moderately well, but the company should consider decreasing their prices by a $1 or $1.50.
  This will be an incentive for customers to use more ride-sharing.

- Even though the total fares for Urban Cities was the highest, the prices are the lowest. While this is good for customers, 
  the drivers are at a disadvantage. The company should increase wages for the drivers while maintaining the fare per ride. 
  Customers, the drivers and the company would all benefit from this.
